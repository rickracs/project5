                    <h2>Beginnings of detective fiction</h2>
                </header>

                <h3>In ancient literature</h3>
                <p>Some scholars, such as R. H. Pfeiffer, have suggested that certain ancient and religious texts bear
                    similarities to what would later be called detective fiction. In the Old Testament story of Susanna
                    and the Elders (the Protestant Bible locates this story within the apocrypha), the account told by
                    two witnesses broke down when Daniel cross-examines them. In response, author Julian Symons has
                    argued that "those who search for fragments of detection in the Bible and Herodotus are looking
                    only for puzzles" and that these puzzles are not detective stories. In the play Oedipus Rex by
                    Ancient Greek playwright Sophocles, the protagonist discovers the truth about his origins after
                    questioning various witnesses. Although "Oedipus's enquiry is based on supernatural, pre-rational
                    methods that are evident in most narratives of crime until the development of Enlightenment thought
                    in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries", this narrative has "all of the central
                    characteristics and formal elements of the detective story, including a mystery surrounding a
                    murder, a closed circle of suspects, and the gradual uncovering of a hidden past."</p>
                <h3>Estabilishment of the genre</h3>

                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Edgar_Allen_Poe_1898.jpg/220px-Edgar_Allen_Poe_1898.jpg">
                    <div class="img-caption">Edgar Allen Poe</div>
                </div>
                <p> Detective fiction in the English-speaking world is considered to have begun in 1841 with the
                    publication of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", featuring "the first fictional
                    detective,
                    the eccentric and brilliant C. Auguste Dupin". When the character first appeared, the word
                    detective did not even exist. However, the character's name, "Dupin", originated from the English
                    word dupe or deception. Poe devised a "plot formula that's been successful ever since, give or
                    take a few shifting variables."Poe followed with further Auguste Dupin tales: "The Mystery of
                    Marie Rogêt" in 1843 and "The Purloined Letter" in 1845.</p>

                    <div class="img-caption">Charles Dickens</div>
                </div>
                <p>Another early example of a whodunit is a subplot in the novel Bleak House (1853) by Charles Dickens.
                    The conniving lawyer Tulkinghorn is killed in his office late one night, and the crime is
                    investigated by Inspector Bucket of the Metropolitan police force. Numerous characters appeared on
                    the staircase leading to Tulkinghorn's office that night, some of them in disguise, and Inspector
                    Bucket must penetrate these mysteries to identify the murderer. Dickens also left a novel
                    unfinished at his death, The Mystery of Edwin Drood.</p>
                <p>Dickens's protégé, Wilkie Collins (1824–1889)—sometimes referred to as the "grandfather of English
                    detective fiction"—is credited with the first great mystery novel, The Woman in White. T. S. Eliot
                    called Collins's novel The Moonstone (1868) "the first, the longest, and the best of modern English
                    detective novels... in a genre invented by Collins and not by Poe", and Dorothy L. Sayers
                    called it "probably the very finest detective story ever written".

                        <div class="img-caption">Arthur Conan Doyle</div>
                    </div>

                    <p>In 1887, Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes, arguably the most famous of all fictional
                        detectives. Although Sherlock Holmes is not the original fiction detective (he was influenced
                        by
                        Poe's Dupin and Gaboriau's Lecoq), his name has become a byword for the part. Conan Doyle
                        stated
                        that the character of Holmes was inspired by Dr. Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle had worked as a
                        clerk
                        at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large conclusions
                        from
                        the smallest observations. A brilliant London-based "consulting detective" residing at 221B
                        Baker Street, Holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess and is renowned for his skillful
                        use of
                        astute observation, deductive reasoning, and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Conan
                        Doyle
                        wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, and all but four stories are
                        narrated by Holmes's friend, assistant, and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson.</p>

                    <p>A general consensus among crime fiction authors is there is a specific set of rules that must be
                        applied for a novel to truly be considered part of the detective fiction genre. As noted in
                        "Introduction to the Analysis of Crime Fiction", crime fiction from the past 100 years has
                        generally contained 8 key rules to be a detective novel:</p>
                    <ul id="classic-features">
                        <li>A crime, most often murder, is committed early in the narrative</li>
                        <li>There are a variety of suspects with different motives</li>
                        <li>A central character formally or informally acts as a detective</li>
                        <li>The detective collects evidence about the crimes and its victim</li>
                        <li>Usually the detective interviews the suspects, as well as the witnesses</li>
                        <li>The detective solves the mystery and indicates the real criminal</li>
                        <li>Usually this criminal is now arrested or otherwise punished</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>Golden age detective novels</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The period between World War I and World War II (the 1920s and 1930s) is generally referred to as
                    the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. During this period, a number of very popular writers
                    emerged, including mostly British but also a notable subset of American and New Zealand writers.
                    Female writers constituted a major portion of notable Golden Age writers. Agatha Christie, Dorothy
                    L. Sayers, Josephine Tey, Margery Allingham, and Ngaio Marsh were particularly famous female
                    writers of this time.</p>
                <p>The most widespread subgenre of the detective novel became the whodunit (or whodunnit, short for
                    "who done it?"). In this subgenre, great ingenuity may be exercised in narrating the crime, usually
                    a homicide, and the subsequent investigation. This objective was to conceal the identity of the
                    criminal from the reader until the end of the book, when the method and culprit are both revealed.</p>
                <p>
                    John Dickson Carr — who also wrote as Carter Dickson — used the “puzzle” approach in his writing
                    which was characterized by including a complex puzzle for the reader to try to unravel. He created
                    ingenious and seemingly impossible plots and is regarded as the master of the "locked room
                    mystery". Two of Carr’s most famous works are The Case of Constant Suicides (1941) and The Hollow
                    Man (1935)</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Agatha Christie</h3>
                <p>Agatha Christie is not only the most famous Golden Age writer, but also considered one of the
                    most
                    famous authors of all genres of all time. At the time of her death in 1976, she was the
                    best-selling
                    novelist in history.</p>
                <p>Many of the most popular books of the Golden Age were written by Agatha Christie. She produced long
                    series of books featuring detective characters like Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, amongst others.
                    Her use of basing her stories on complex puzzles, combined with her stereotyped characters and
                    picturesque middle-class settings, is credited for her success. Christie's works include
                    Murder on the Orient Express (1934), Death on the Nile (1937), and And Then There Were None (1939).</p>

                    <h2>Subgenres of detective fiction</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="img-div img-left">
                    <img src="./media/sam-spade.jpg">
                    <div class="img-caption">H.Bogart as Sam Spade</div>
                </div>
                <h3>Standard private eye</h3>
                <p>Martin Hewitt, created by British author Arthur Morrison in 1894, is one of the first examples of
                    the modern style of fictional private detective. This character is described as an "Everyman"
                    detective meant to challenge the detective-as-superman that Holmes represented.</p>
                <p>In the 1930s, the private eye genre was adopted wholeheartedly by American writers. One of the
                    primary contributors to this style was Dashiell Hammett with his famous private investigator
                    character, Sam Spade. His style of crime fiction came to be known as "hardboiled", which is
                    described as a genre that "usually deals with criminal activity in a modern urban environment, a
                    world of disconnected signs and anonymous strangers."</p>
                <p>In the late 1930s, Raymond Chandler updated the form with his private detective Philip Marlowe, who
                    brought a more intimate voice to the detective than the more distanced "operative's report" style
                    of Hammett's Continental Op stories.</p>
                <h3>Inverted detective</h3>
                <p>An inverted detective story, also known as a "howcatchem", is a murder mystery fiction structure in
                    which the commission of the crime is shown or described at the beginning, usually including the
                    identity of the perpetrator. The story then describes the detective's attempt to solve the
                    mystery. There may also be subsidiary puzzles, such as why the crime was committed, and they are
                    explained or resolved during the story. This format is the opposite of the more typical "whodunit",
                    where all of the details of the perpetrator of the crime are not revealed until the story's climax.</p>
                <h3>Police Procedural</h3>
                <p>Many detective stories have police officers as the main characters. These stories may take a variety
                    of forms, but many authors try to realistically depict the routine activities of a group of police
                    officers who are frequently working on more than one case simultaneously. Some of these stories are
                    whodunits; in others, the criminal is well known, and it is a case of getting enough evidence.</p>
                <div class="img-div img-left">
                    <img src="./media/miss-marple.jpg">
                    <div class="img-caption">J.Hickson as Miss Marple</div>
                </div>
                <h3>Cozy mysteries</h3>
                <p>"Cozy mysteries" began in the late 20th century as a reinvention of the Golden Age whodunit; these
                    novels generally shy away from violence and suspense and frequently feature female amateur
                    detectives. Modern cozy mysteries are frequently, though not necessarily in either case, humorous
                    and thematic (culinary mystery, animal mystery, quilting mystery, etc.)</p>
                <p>This style features minimal violence, sex, and social relevance; a solution achieved by intellect or
                    intuition rather than police procedure, with order restored in the end; honorable and well bred
                    characters; and a setting in a closed community. Writers include Agatha Christie, Dorothy L.
                    Sayers, and Elizabeth Daly.</p>
                <h3>Serial killer mystery</h3>
                <p>Another subgenre of detective fiction is the serial killer mystery, which might be thought of as an
                    outcropping of the police procedural. There are early mystery novels in which a police force
                    attempts to contend with the type of criminal known in the 1920s as a homicidal maniac, such as a
                    few of the early novels of Philip Macdonald and Ellery Queen's Cat of Many Tails. However, this
                    sort of story became much more popular after the coining of the phrase "serial killer" in the 1970s
                    and the publication of The Silence of the Lambs in 1988. These stories frequently show the
                    activities of many members of a police force or government agency in their efforts to apprehend a
                    killer who is selecting victims on some obscure basis. They are also often much more violent and
                    suspenseful than other mysteries.</p>
                <h3>Legal thriller or courtroom</h3>
                <p>The legal thriller or courtroom novel is also related to detective fiction. The system of justice
                    itself is always a major part of these works. In this way, the legal system provides the framework
                    for the legal
                    thriller as much as the system of modern police work does for the police procedural. The legal
                    thriller usually starts its business with the court proceedings following the closure of an
                    investigation, often resulting in a new angle on the investigation, so as to bring about a final
                    outcome different from the one originally devised by the investigators. In the legal thriller,
                    court proceedings play a very active, if not to say decisive part in a case reaching its ultimate
                    solution.</p>
                <div class="img-div img-left">
                    <img src="./media/locked-room-rue.JPG">
                    <div class="img-caption">Murders in the Rue Morgue</div>
                </div>
                <h3>Locked-room mystery</h3>
                <p>The locked-room mystery is a subgenre of detective fiction in which a crime—almost always murder—is
                    committed under circumstances which it was seemingly impossible for the perpetrator to commit the
                    crime and/or evade detection in the course of getting in and out of the crime scene. The genre was
                    established in the 19th century. Edgar Allen Poe’s "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" (1841) is
                    considered the first locked-room mystery; since then, other authors have used the scheme. The crime
                    in question typically involves a crime scene with no indication as to how the intruder could have
                    entered or left, i.e., a locked room. Following other conventions of classic detective fiction, the
                    reader is normally presented with the puzzle and all of the clues, and is encouraged to solve the
                    mystery before the solution is revealed in a dramatic climax.</p>

                    details or parts of the plot, and sometimes—for example in the case of Mickey Spillane's novel I,
                    the Jury—even the solution. After the credits of Billy Wilder's film Witness for the Prosecution,
                    the cinemagoers are asked not to talk to anyone about the plot so that future viewers will also be
                    able to fully enjoy the unravelling of the mystery.</p>
                <h3>Plausibility and coincidence</h3>
                <p>For series involving amateur detectives, their frequent encounters with crime often test the limits
                    of plausibility. The character Miss Marple, for instance, dealt with an estimated two murders a
                    year.</p>
                <p>The television series Monk has often made fun of this implausible frequency. The main character,
                    Adrian Monk, is frequently accused of being a "bad luck charm" and a "murder magnet" as the result
                    of the frequency with which murder happens in his vicinity.</p>
                <h3>Effects of technology</h3>
                <p>Technological progress has also rendered many plots implausible and antiquated. For example, the
                    predominance of mobile phones, pagers, and PDAs has significantly altered the previously dangerous
                    situations in which investigators traditionally might have found themselves.</p>
                <p>One tactic that avoids the issue of technology altogether is the historical detective genre. As
                    global interconnectedness makes legitimate suspense more difficult to achieve, several
                    writers—including Elizabeth Peters, P. C. Doherty, Steven Saylor, and Lindsey Davis—have eschewed
                    fabricating convoluted plots in order to manufacture tension, instead opting to set their
                    characters in some former period. Such a strategy forces the protagonist to rely on more inventive
                    means of investigation, lacking as they do the technological tools available to modern detectives.</p>
                <p>As technology advances, so does the genre of crime fiction, as we now have the issue of cyber crime,
                    or a crime that involves a computer and a network.[54] There is also the new issue of
                    cyberterrorism, which is being more frequently incorporated into modern crime fiction.</p>

                    <h2>Influential fictional detectives</h2>
                </header>
                <h3>Sherlock Holmes</h3>
                <code>"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."</code>
                <p>Sherlock Holmes is British detective fiction written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The first appearance
                    of Sherlock Holmes is at “A study in Scarlet”. After Sherlock Holmes, many detective stories
                    followed Conan
                    Doyle’s structure and also include characters which have Sherlock Holmes characteristics.</p>

                <p>Sherlock Holmes as a series is perhaps the most popular form of detective fiction. Doyle attempted
                    to kill the character off after twenty-three stories, but by popular request, he continued to write
                    the Sherlock Holmes series. Sherlock Holmes is not only referenced as the titular character, but
                    has also influenced many other areas outside of detective fiction.</p>

                <h3>Hercule Poirot</h3>
                <code>"It is the brain, the little gray cells on which one must rely. One must seek the truth within--not without."</code>
                <p>Hercule Poirot is a fictional Belgian private detective, created by Agatha Christie. As the one of
                    Christie's most famous and long-lived characters, he appeared in 33 novels, one play (Black
                    Coffee), and more than 50 short stories published between 1920 and 1975. The stories are throughout
                    the Hercule Poirot’s whole life in the UK, which he first appeared in The Mysterious Affair at
                    Styles (published in 1920) and died in Curtain (published in 1975), which is Agatha Christie’s last
                    work. August 6, 1975, The New York Times published the obituary of Poirot’s death and the cover of
                    the newly published novel on the front page.</p>

                <h3>C. Auguste Dupin</h3>
                <code>"The solution of a crime made my blood pump. I thought it was my reason for living."</code>
                <p>Le Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin is a fictional character created by Edgar Allan Poe. Dupin made his
                    first appearance in Poe's "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" (1841). He reappears in "The Mystery of
                    Marie Rogêt" (1842) and "The Purloined Letter" (1844).</p>
                <p>C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction. The character served
                    as the prototype for many that were created later, including Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle
                    and Hercule Poirot by Agatha Christie.</p>

                <h3>Ellery Queen</h3>
                <code>"It was wrong. It was like arresting the gun for murder."</code>
                <p>Ellery Queen is a fictional detective-hero, created by Manfred Bennington Lee (1905-1971), and
                    Frederic Dannay (1905～1982), as well as a joint pseudonym for the cousins Dannay and Lee. Ellery
                    Queen first appeared in The Roman Hat Mystery (1929), and was the hero of more than 30 novels and
                    several short story collections, During the 1930s and much of the 1940s, that detective-hero was
                    possibly the best known American fictional detective.</p>
              
                <h3>Matthew Scudder</h3>
                <code>"I do favors for people and in return, they give me gifts."</code>
                <p>Matt Scudder is a reformed alcoholic and unlicensed private eye created by Lawrence Block. The
                    character debuted in 1976's The Sins of the Fathers, since then he appeared in eighteen novels and
                    numerous short-stories.
